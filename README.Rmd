## 2. Study workflow

Use the following scripts in order to repeat population extractions and analysis of the study

  1.**buffers.R**
    
  - Coral reef data cleaning
  - Custom function to project coral reef buffers by country
  - Buffer creation for distances (5km, 10km, 30km, 50km, 100km)
  - Buffer data cleaning
  - Coral reef country spatial dataframe
  - US buffer creation
    
  2.**population_extraction_functions.R**
    
  - Population extraction functions for use with LandScan raster data
    
  3.**population_extraction_functions_US.R**
    
  - Population extraction functions for US states associated with coral reefs
    
  4.**Population_merging_wrangling.R**
    
  - Merging population data for coral reef countries
    - Only 2020 and 2019 examples included in repository
    - Obtaining population growth values from The World Bank
  - Summarising for "world" statistics (all coral reef countries)
  - Creating dataframes for plotting:
    - Region
    - SID
    - Income_group

  5.**population_plotting.R**
    
  - Plotting figures from study 
    - Excluding code for bump graphs
